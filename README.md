Hey! This is a website to describe me :)

I am from East Brunswick, New Jersey.
I am currently a Senior at East Brunswick High School and plan on attending Rutgers Business School- New Brunswick in Fall of 2020
I have my own podcast available on most platforms called Bogocast.
This podcast studies people from my town and how their surroundings helped shape them into the person they are today.
I am a state finalist for Future Business Leaders of America, I played Varsity Football for the school team, and I am the captain of the East Brunswick Soccer Club U-18 Travel Team, and am a former Chess State Champion. 
I have over 200 volunteer hours that range from an adult day care to helping special needs swim.
I try to be the best person I can be and I hope you enjoy my web page :)
